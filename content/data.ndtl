Why are there so many tech layoffs, and why should we be worried? Stanford scholar explains

    "> Why are so many tech companies laying people off right now?
    & The tech industry layoffs are basically an instance of social contagion, in which companies imitate what others are doing. If you look for reasons for why companies do layoffs, the reason is that everybody else is doing it. Layoffs are the result of imitative behavior and are not particularly evidence-based.
    & I’ve had people say to me that they know layoffs are harmful to company well-being, let alone the well-being of employees, and don’t accomplish much, but everybody is doing layoffs and their board is asking why they aren’t doing layoffs also.
    & > Do you think layoffs in tech are some indication of a tech bubble bursting or the company preparing for a recession?
    & Could there be a tech recession? Yes. Was there a bubble in valuations? Absolutely. Did Meta overhire? Probably. But is that why they are laying people off? Of course not. Meta has plenty of money. These companies are all making money. They are doing it because other companies are doing it.
    & > What are some myths or misunderstandings about layoffs?
    & Layoffs often do not cut costs, as there are many instances of laid-off employees being hired back as contractors, with companies paying the contracting firm. Layoffs often do not increase stock prices, in part because layoffs can signal that a company is having difficulty. Layoffs do not increase productivity. Layoffs do not solve what is often the underlying problem, which is often an ineffective strategy, a loss of market share, or too little revenue. Layoffs are basically a bad decision."

    "Notice that marketplace is slipped in that concluding phrase, close by but distinct from content. When Gates says content is king, he is not talking from the point of view of a content provider – the laborer tied to the ADAT for whom the short-term, remember, will be filled with “a lot of disappointment.” He is speaking from the castle where the winners live – “those who use the medium to deliver information and entertainment.” Deliver, not create. Gates was talking about becoming a king by owning the marketplace, not the content itself.
    & My labor as a content provider is not at all what Gates had in mind. He didn’t have any labor in mind. He was talking as a capitalist – owner of the network, to use his broadcast analogy. It’s just that the network in this case (the internet) was publicly owned, so he had to invent a way to privatize and profit from that shared technology."

They will also demonstrate why each system can’t be summarised by its ‘bits’, megahertz, amount of RAM and whatnot.

Bear in mind that tech has gotten really complicated lately, so if you struggle to follow my latest articles, try reading the early ones first.

    "Back in the early days of computing, we were, as always, extremely bad at making software. Except it was fine as most computers were practically custom-made to their purpose and only had the power to be able to tackle relatively simple problems. Simple problems meant simple software. This didn’t last long, Moore’s law being a more concrete reality back then, computers steadily became more powerful which led them to being applied to more complex problems.
    & This did not go well.
    & By 1968, this was a full-blown crisis:
    & 'There is a widening gap between ambitions and achievements in software engineering. This gap appears in several dimensions: between promises to users and performance achieved by software, between what seems to be ultimately possible and what is achievable now and between estimates of software costs and expenditures. The gap is arising at a time when the consequences of software failure in all its aspects are becoming increasingly serious. Particularly alarming is the seemingly unavoidable fallibility of large software, since a malfunction in an advanced hardware-software system can be a matter of life and death, not only for individuals, but also for vehicles carrying hundreds of people and ultimately for nations as well.'"

    "There's a popular anecdote about a class of pot makers: the class is split into two groups. One is going to be judged by their pots' quality, the other by their quantity. Each of the people in the first group tries to make a single beautiful pot, while the people in the other group quickly churn them out. At the end of the class, the second group not only has the most pots, but also the best ones.
    & I have no idea whether this actually happened, but I've certainly seen people who have been "working on a novel" for years, and others who have in that time written a lot. If you were to write, say, a short story a month, then by the end of five years you'd have sixty of them, and by that point probably at least a few would have been published.
    & There's a few ways you could read into this. One is safety in numbers: by creating lots of things, some are bound to be better than others, and you can cherrypick the best ones to share and promote. This is far better than believing you have only one story to tell, and tinkering with it until the day allegedly will come that you deem it finished. Another way of reading into it is that practicing, that is actively making things, whether you deem yourself already accomplished or not, improves your skillset in the process.
    & I've seen people labour for months over a single song, which is unfortunate given how little anyone else will likely care about such a small thing. I think most people would rather hear several interesting songs than one finely polished song.
    & Even worse, for the engineers amongst us, all this energy being misdirected into a single project is even more finely poured into a less interesting aspect of it — the quality of the mix, or miniscule refinements of a single sound, rather than the buildup and flow of the sections, or even more importantly, the catchiness of the tunes themselves."

    "I believe, deeply, in the positive value of guilt, shame, and contrition. I think working through your shit and contemplating the harm you’ve done is important, and I’ve tried to do a lot of it in the past few years. And I think we all should push back against the “nothing matters but what you want and how you feel” brand of sociopathy that’s popular now in inspirational memes. There’s a notion running around our culture that feeling bad about something you’ve done is always some sort of disordered trauma response, but that’s destructive bullshit. Most of the time when you feel bad about something you’ve done, you should. I’ve spent my adult lifetime trying to make amends to people I’ve hurt, and trying to understand my own culpability when my control over myself was not complete. I think about things I’ve done, and feel shame for them, every day of my life. I don’t want to wallow and I don’t think guilt in and of itself is productive. I am however certain that my guilt is an appropriate endowment to me.
    & But it’s become abundantly clear that there simply is no value in public apology. Admitting fault only emboldens critics. The mechanisms of social media always reward escalation and never reward calm and restraint. Contemporary progressive politics excuse any amount of personal viciousness so long as the target is perceived to be guilty of committing some identity crime. The notion of proportionality is totally alien to these worlds, and when people ask for such proportionality they’re accused of supporting bigotry. People who are friendly online shamelessly wage backchannel campaigns against each other, and almost no one on social media has the stomach to stand up for someone else when the mob comes for them. Most importantly, the public can never grant you absolution for what you’ve done; absolution is not the public’s to grant. The strangers on Twitter can’t accept an apology, even if they ever would, and they wouldn't. You can ask the mob for forgiveness, but they have no moral right to grant it, and anyway they never will. They’ll just keep you wriggling on the end of a pin forever. Honestly: how often do people who make public apologies come out ahead in doing so, especially because they’re so often coerced and thus insincere?
    & Apology itself is good. But public apology is a useless and self-defeating ritual. If you have done something wrong to another, I recommend that you privately apologize to them. That person can then accept your apology or not. They can publicize your apology or not. But all of the moral value of apologizing will be preserved, while nothing of practical value to your life will be lost. Look, if nothing else it’s indisputable that public apology has no consistent ability to reduce criticism, and I think it’s obvious that in fact such apologies just show that blood is in the water. You’ve heard it from me many times: there’s a profound nihilism in American life right now about the potential for positive change. So many people, of so many political stripes, have given up. And I think that plus the truly ruinous and sadistic influence of social networks and their reward systems have created this ever-seething mob that constantly casts around for its next scalp. We can’t get real change, but by god, we can make people cower! You can’t apologize to that. You shouldn’t negotiate with terrorists."

    "It’s possible that the analogy multiple professors pointed to — filing cabinets — is no longer useful since many students Drossman’s age spent their high school years storing documents in the likes of OneDrive and Dropbox rather than in physical spaces. It could also have to do with the other software they’re accustomed to — dominant smartphone apps like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube all involve pulling content from a vast online sea rather than locating it within a nested hierarchy. “When I want to scroll over to Snapchat, Twitter, they’re not in any particular order, but I know exactly where they are,” says Vogel, who is a devoted iPhone user. Some of it boils down to muscle memory.
    & But it may also be that in an age where every conceivable user interface includes a search function, young people have never needed folders or directories for the tasks they do. The first internet search engines were used around 1990, but features like Windows Search and Spotlight on macOS are both products of the early 2000s. Most of 2017’s college freshmen were born in the very late ‘90s. They were in elementary school when the iPhone debuted; they’re around the same age as Google.

    "Instead of storing the data on-chain, NFTs instead contain a URL that points to the data. What surprised me about the standards was that there’s no hash commitment for the data located at the URL. Looking at many of the NFTs on popular marketplaces being sold for tens, hundreds, or millions of dollars, that URL often just points to some VPS running Apache somewhere. Anyone with access to that machine, anyone who buys that domain name in the future, or anyone who compromises that machine can change the image, title, description, etc for the NFT to whatever they’d like at any time (regardless of whether or not they “own” the token). There’s nothing in the NFT spec that tells you what the image “should” be, or even allows you to confirm whether something is the “correct” image.
    & So as an experiment, I made an NFT that changes based on who is looking at it, since the web server that serves the image can choose to serve different images based on the IP or User Agent of the requester. For example, it looked one way on OpenSea, another way on Rarible, but when you buy it and view it from your crypto wallet, it will always display as a large 💩 emoji. What you bid on isn’t what you get. There’s nothing unusual about this NFT, it’s how the NFT specifications are built. Many of the highest priced NFTs could turn into 💩 emoji at any time; I just made it explicit."
    & "[...] What I found most interesting, though, is that after OpenSea removed my NFT, it also no longer appeared in any crypto wallet on my device. This is web3, though, how is that possible?"
    & "[...] All this means that if your NFT is removed from OpenSea, it also disappears from your wallet. It doesn’t functionally matter that my NFT is indelibly on the blockchain somewhere, because the wallet (and increasingly everything else in the ecosystem) is just using the OpenSea API to display NFTs, which began returning 304 No Content for the query of NFTs owned by my address!"

What was often praised in that scene as "brilliant" or the next big thing was unique in only way and totally forgettable in every other way, echoing startup culture's interest in empty "next big thing" ideas, the most extreme embodiment of which was Theranos. The vacuousness of what was being celebrated as brilliant ended up being a lot of what I started writing about on this blog and elsewhere.

    "But despite this, there’s a cottage industry devoted to making fun of COBOL precisely for its strengths. COBOL’s qualities of being relatively self-documenting, having a short onboarding period (though a long path to becoming an expert), and having been originally designed by committee for big, unglamorous, infrastructural business systems all count against it. So does the fact that it did not come out of a research-oriented context, like languages such as C, ALGOL, or FORTRAN.
    & In a broader sense, hating COBOL was—and is—part of a struggle between consolidating and protecting computer programmers’ professional prestige on the one hand, and making programming less opaque and more accessible on the other. There’s an old joke among programmers: “If it was hard to write, it should be hard to read.” In other words, if your code is easy to understand, maybe you and your skills aren’t all that unique or valuable. If management thinks the tools you use and the code you write could be easily learned by anyone, you are eminently replaceable."

But modern computing has started to become undone, and to undo other parts of our societies, through the field’s high opinion of itself, and through the way that it concentrates power into the hands of programmers who mistake social, political, and economic problems for technical ones, often with disastrous results."

    "This is a profound psychological violence here. How can one even begin to speak of dignity in labor when one secretly feels one’s job should not exist? How can it not create a sense of deep rage and resentment? Yet it is the peculiar genius of our society that its rulers have figured out a way, as in the case of the fish fryers, to ensure that rage is directed precisely against those who actually do get to do meaningful work. For instance: in our society, there seems to be a general rule that, the more obviously one’s work benefits other people, the less one is likely to be paid for it. Again, an objective measure is hard to find, but one easy way to get a sense is to ask: What would happen were this entire class of people to simply disappear? Say what you like about nurses, garbage collectors, or mechanics, it’s obvious that were they to vanish in a puff of smoke, the results would be immediate and catastrophic. A world without teachers or dockworkers would soon be in trouble, and even one without science-fiction writers or ska musicians would clearly be a lesser place. It’s not entirely clear how humanity would suffer were all private equity CEOs, lobbyists, PR researchers, actuaries, telemarketers, bailiffs, or legal consultants to similarly vanish. (Many suspect it might improve markedly.) Yet apart from a handful of well-touted exceptions (doctors), the rule holds surprisingly well.
    & Even more perverse, there seems to be a broad sense that this is the way things should be. This is one of the secret strengths of right-wing populism. You can see it when tabloids whip up resentment against tube workers for paralyzing London during contract disputes: the very fact that tube workers can paralyze London shows that their work is actually necessary, but this seems to be precisely what annoys people. It’s even clearer in the United States, where Republicans have had remarkable success mobilizing resentment against schoolteachers and autoworkers (and not, significantly, against the school administrators or auto industry executives who actually cause the problems) for their supposedly bloated wages and benefits. It’s as if they are being told “But you get to teach children! Or make cars! You get to have real jobs! And on top of that, you have the nerve to also expect middle-class pensions and health care?”
    & If someone had designed a work regime perfectly suited to maintaining the power of finance capital, it’s hard to see how he or she could have done a better job. Real, productive workers are relentlessly squeezed and exploited. The remainder are divided between a terrorized stratum of the universally reviled unemployed and a larger stratum who are basically paid to do nothing, in positions designed to make them identify with the perspectives and sensibilities of the ruling class (managers, administrators, etc.)—and particularly its financial avatars—but, at the same time, foster a simmering resentment against anyone whose work has clear and undeniable social value. Clearly, the system was never consciously designed. It emerged from almost a century of trial and error. But it is the only explanation for why, despite our technological capacities, we are not all working three- to four-hour days."

    & The old way of thinking was that engineers develop a product, and then pass it on to a manufacturer (or the manufacturing department for big companies) who would then figure out how to actually make it. There was little to no interaction between engineering and manufacturing.
    & But that’s a horrible way to develop products, which is why successful companies have abandoned this process.
    & It’s much better to develop a product with manufacturing in mind from the beginning. For example, a simple design change can have a huge impact on making the product easier and faster to manufacture.

IMPORTANT KEYWORDS FOR EMBEDDED IN C - A CHEATSHEET
  TAGS : code, embedded
  TERM
    > extern - storage classifier keyword to tell compiler variable or function is defined outside scope of this file. Sometimes optional when assumed by compiler.
    & static - tells compiler that local variable in function's value persists each time it is called from whatever value it held the time before i.e. memory is not released after function ends. When used globally it prevents other files from accessing or modifying that variable. Can also go in front of function declaration to prevent it being called from outside function.
    & const - enforeces a read-only attribute on variables. preferred syntax is [data type] const [var declatation]; though data type and const can be in either order. Const throws error if you try and modify the variable by its name BUT you CAN still change the value by its address. On stm32, global const variables live in flash memory, so if trying to modify the variable by its address it will not work because flash is write-protected. When using const on a pointer (const *pData), the pointer can still be modified but the data it points to can not. If written (*const pData) with the asterisk outside const, it means the pointer is unmodifiable but the data it points to is. const is essentially a safeguard for data that should not be changed, not that it always can't be changed. also can help compiler generate more optimized code and improve readability. Use generously especially in function prototypes.
    & volatile - tells compiler that data may unexpectedly change at any time and not to do any optimization on it. Use with memory-mapped peripheral registers of the microcontroller, multiple tasks accessing global read/write variables in an RTOS multithread application, or when a global variable is used to share data between the main code and an ISR code. ISRs are global flags/variables or interrupt requests coming from multiple external I/O sources which may occur simultaneously. For registers, use non-volatile pointer to volatile data ex: uint8_t volatile *pStatusReg;. Also use for intentional delays/empty 'for' loops such as for debouncing, otherwise compiler will remove it because it slows the application down.
    & const and volatile can be used together, especially for data that should not be modified by the programmer (const) but will have unexpected changes from external world (volatile)

BITWISE OPERATORS FOR EMBEDDED IN C - A CHEATSHEET
  TAGS : code, embedded
  TERM
    > Testing of bits (&[and]) - Bits are tested against a masked value, which is a number chosen for a test that uses all zeros except for the bits that are being tested. Good for on/off and switches.
    & Setting of bits(|[or]) - Bits are adjusted to specific values. Masked value uses | to set 0s to 1s.
    & Clearing of bits(~[not] and &) - & can be used with 0s to clear bits and 1s to leave those bits alone, ~ can be used as a nice shortcut involving left shifts.
    & Toggling of bits(^[XOR]) - a 1 will toggle the bit at that position
    & Bitwise shift operators are << and >>. Bits of the 1st operant will be shifted right(>>) or left (<<) by the amount decided by the second operand. Shifting right/left in binary format moves all bit positions right/left and leftmost/rightmost positions are filled with empty 0s. Right shift decreases value, left shift increases. A value is multiplied by 2 for each left shift, divided by 2 for each right shift.
    & One shortcut to creating mask values: create mask value of 1 and << left shift by the bit position you are wanting to set. ex: data = data | (1<<4); to set 4th bit. Can also clear by using the same method to shift a 1 to the bit you want to clear and use ~. ex: data & ~(1<<4); to clear 4th bit
    & Bit extraction - extract a range of bits by right shifting (>>) the identified portion to until it touches the 0th bit (least significant bit), then mask the value to extract only 6 bits and save to another variable. ex: output = (uint8_t) ((data >> 9) & 0x003F); where data is 16 bits being typecasted to 8 bit output

POINTERS IN C - A CHEATSHEET
  TAGS : code
  TERM
    > pointers/addresses are always unsigned data
    & & = gets the address of a data/var ("pass by reference")
    & * = gets the data/var located at address (dereference)
    & int *p = &n; stores the address of n in variable p
    & calling *p "dereferences" address of data
    & -> is used in place of dot notation to access the members of the structure or the unions using pointers
    & Address of an array in C is actually the address of the first byte of the array, which is fine because data in an array is stored consecutively
    & Assigning a &[variable] to pointer variable needs to be typecast as such. ex. char *pAddress = (char*)&data;
    & Declaring a pointer variable needs a * after the data type declaration. ex. char* address1 = (char*) 0x0007FFF8E3C3824; needs to be typecasted to fit into char data type. The compiler will always reserve same # of bytes reguardless of the data type but the data type instead determines the behavior of operations(read, write, increment, decrement, etc) carried out on the pointer variable and how many bytes of information the result will yield. (So seems like generally you want to choose a pointer type that uses the same size as the data that it is pointing to)
    & What data is read from a pointer depends on data type used, for ex. char data = *address1; will fetch only 1 byte because char is being used
    & Conventional to write pointers for variable locations with p[variablename]
    & &[variable]'s data type will be [data type]* by default

    ———FRUITS AND VEGETABLES———
    & -ONIONS: buy them fresh and store them in dry, enclosed spaces, and buy tomatoes canned and without salt added. Use onions in almost everything, they’re delicious, cheap, and nutritious.
    & -TOMATOES: Good fresh and better canned. Use fresh tomatoes raw for whatever you want and use canned tomatoes for sauces. Buy canned tomatoes with as little added salt and sugar as possible.
    & POTATOES: Treat these as a starch option similar to grains or cereals. Buy them unprocessed, in a sack. Store them in dry, enclosed spaces.
    & -BASICALLY EVERY FRUIT: go for it, these things are nutrient bombs and they’re delicious. Buy them seasonally for the best value and if you have a day to do so, preserve them if you ever see a huge sale. I’m still enjoying lacto-fermented blueberries from last year’s insane blueberry harvest where I could buy a pint for a dollar.
    & -FOR SHOPPING: Generally when you buy produce you should go, in order, to the discount rack, then the sales, and then everything else. Someone out there has a recipe for literally everything, and some of them are even good. A pepper with a blemish or tiny spot of mold is still fine, assuming you cut away the blemish or tiny spot of mold.
    & -I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH; FIND THE UNDER-APPRECIATED AND OVER-SUPPLIED PRODUCE. There’s always a bin of some forgotten veggie no-one eats for some reason. In the west, at least, it seems to often be rutabagas/turnips. I’ve also seen apples in the fall, corn, and cabbages fall into this category. This is because of a good harvest, or because of a lack of consumer interest - any time this happens, capitalize on it. Everything is delicious if you cook it properly. Buy seasonally, and learn how to use the things you buy. You’ll eat like a king and pay like a pauper.
    & ——-PROTEINS——-
    & -IF YOU EAT MEAT, buy the least processed cuts you can. Whole chickens, meat on the bone, and ground meats are your best friends. Go to butcher shops, if you can. Freezing meat is fine, but try to avoid buying pre-made frozen protein options. Get raw product and do the work yourself to save a LOT of cash and get better food out of it.
    & -MEAT IS A LUXURY, NOT AN ESSENTIAL. I say this because in modern western culture eating meat everyday is seen as normal. This is an oddity when we examine all of human history, and this notion should be abandoned if we’re trying to live more affordably. Meat is grossly overrepresented in most diets, and you should always ask if you could cut your portion of meat down in exchange for more vegetables and grains.
    & -LEARN HOW TO BREAK DOWN YOUR PROTEINS. A chicken isn’t just 8 portions of meat - it’s also bones and carcass for a stock or soup, fat to be rendered out and used as a cooking oil (thanks, jewish folks!), and skin to be cooked down into delicious little chips. This same list can be used for pork, beef, and any other mammal you eat.

  QOTE : "The second and more probable [explanation] comes from the realization that when the boat refuses to float, there was nothing better to have around than a couple of the wooden crates the roosters and pigs were kept in on ships. In the case of a shipwreck, there was really only one viable option when the lifeboats filled up: find the most buoyant object within arm’s reach, hold on for your fucking life, and hope a shark doesn’t bite off a leg. At best, you’d be able to scramble atop a broken plank or, if you’re really fortunate, a bulkier item like a passenger’s chest or the door to the captain’s chamber, but chances are you’d end up in a pigsty or chicken coop. Indeed, the light weight crates would often float and because of this, the two animals had a higher survival rate in ship wrecks. The cages of these lovely animals prevented so many drownings (although exposure and the sharks got pretty much everybody if another ship didn’t come by soon) that sailors would get a pig and rooster tattoo for good luck in case such an event happened to them!"

    "When you consider the Dreyfus model, you’ll notice that there is a trend over time from being heavily rules-oriented and having no understanding of the big picture to being extremely intuitive and fully grasping the big picture. The Advanced Beginner stage is the last one in which the skill acquirer has no understanding of the big picture.
    & As such, it’s the last phase in which the acquirer might confuse himself with an Expert. A Competent has too much of a handle on the big picture to confuse himself with an Expert: he knows what he doesn’t know. This isn’t true during the Advanced Beginner phase, since Advanced Beginners are on the “unskilled” end of the Dunning Kruger Effect and tend to epitomize the notion that, “if I don’t understand it, it must be easy.”
    & As such, Advanced Beginners can break one of two ways: they can move to Competent and start to grasp the big picture and their place in it, or they can ‘graduate’ to Expert Beginner by assuming that they’ve graduated to Expert.
    & ...The Expert Beginner has nowhere to go because progression requires an understanding that he has a lot of work to do, and that is not a readily available conclusion. You’ll notice that the Expert Beginner is positioned slightly above Advanced Beginner but not on the level of Competence. This is because he is not competent enough to grasp the big picture and recognize the irony of his situation, but he is slightly more competent than the Advanced Beginner due mainly to, well, extensive practice being a Beginner."

TARGETING MASTERING LOUDNESS FOR STREAMING - WHY NOT TO DO IT

  QOTE
    Regarding mastering to streaming LUFS loudness normalization targets - I do not recommend trying to do that. I know it's discussed all over the web, but in reality very few people actually do it. To test this, try turning loudness matching off in Spotify settings, then check out the tracks listed under "New Releases" and see if you can find material that's not mastered to modern loudness for it's genre. You will probably find little to none. Here's why people aren't doing it:
    & 1 - In the real world, loudness normalization is not always engaged. For example, Spotify Web Player and Spotify apps integrated into third-party devices (such as speakers and TVs) don’t currently use loudness normalization. And some listeners may have it switched off in their apps. If it's off then your track will sound much softer than most other tracks.
    & 2- Even with loudness normalization turned on, many people have reported that their softer masters sound quieter than loud masters when streamed.
    & 3 - Each streaming service has a different loudness target and there's no guarantee that they won't change their loudness targets in the future. For example, Spotify lowered their loudness target by 3dB in 2017. Also, now in Spotify Premium app settings you find 3 different loudness settings; "Quiet, Normal, and Loud". It's a moving target. How do the various loudness options differ? - The Spotify Community
    & 4 - Most of the streaming services don't even use LUFS to measure loudness in their algorithms. Many use "ReplayGain" or their own unique formula. Tidal is the only one that uses LUFS, so using a LUFS meter to try to match the loudness targets of most of the services is guesswork. Edit: In September 2019 YouTube switched to -14 LUFS. In December 2020 Spotify began transitioning from "ReplayGain+3dB" to -14 LUFS. It's good that a normalization standard is emerging. It's also more evidence that they can change these targets at any time.
    & 5 - If you happen to undershoot their loudness target, some of the streaming sites (Spotify, for one) will apply their own limiter to your track in order to raise the level without causing clipping. You might prefer to have your mastering engineer handle the limiting.
    & 6 - Digital aggregators (CD Baby, TuneCore, etc.) generally do not allow more than one version of each song per submission, so if you want a loud master for your CD/downloads but a softer master for streaming then you have to make a separate submission altogether. If you did do that it would become confusing to keep track of the different versions (would they each need different ISRC codes?).
    & It has become fashionable to post online about targeting -14LUFS or so, but in my opinion, if you care about sounding approximately as loud as other artists, and until loudness normalization improves and becomes universally implemented, that is mostly well-meaning internet chatter, not good practical advice. My advice is to make one digital master that sounds good, is not overly crushed for loudness, and use it for everything. Let the various streaming sites normalize it as they wish. It will still sound just as good.

    “The most expensive Japanese hotels are not luxury resorts but ryokan, traditional Japanese establishments,” he says. “This is a very unique phenomenon: traditional service in Japan is more expensive and refined than the five-star hotels imported from the West.”
    & That said, Hara wonders about how to emulate the value embodied in a ryokan. “Japan needs to think of a way to make this function in a global context,” he says. It’s about capturing the “richness” valued by Japan, as opposed to the “opulence” valued by the West, he says.
    & What these references to folk-craft and traditions suggest is that the only way forward for Japanese design is through reactivated anachronisms — taking the items which were created in Japan’s past and interpreting them in the present.
    & “I don’t feel that anachronism is the right term,” Hara says, “but if you want to trace back the aesthetics of my design, you have to go to the late Muromachi Period (1392-1573), where the aesthetic roots of Japan were created.”
    & His assistant returns, silently signalling the end of the interview. Hara, however, hasn’t quite finished yet.
    & “I’m not trying to go back to the past and say it’s beautiful and wonderful but, just like unearthing minerals, I’m trying to unearth those resources from the past as energy to propel us into the future.”
